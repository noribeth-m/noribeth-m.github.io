Hi, there! My name is Noribeth Mariscal. I'm in my final year as a PhD candidate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, working with Dr. Yaoxian Huang ([Huang Research Lab](https://www.huanglabwayne.com/)). My research focuses on understanding tropospheric ozone atmospheric chemistry and understanding its interaction with air pollution, human, and ecosystem health, using a high-resolution global modeling approach. With current advancements in high-resolution global chemistry-climate modeling, studying the impacts of ozone at exposure relevant scales has become more feasible, making it a tool for climate science appplications with societal relevance. My research leverages tools such as MUSICAv0 (MUlti-Scale Infrastructure for Chemistry and Aerosols, Version 0) and CAM-chem (Community Atmosphere Model with chemistry) within the Community Earth System Model (CESM), participation is field campaigns (i.e., [MOOSE](https://www-air.larc.nasa.gov/missions/moose/) and [USOS](https://csl.noaa.gov/groups/csl7/measurements/2024usos/), and the use of the Python programming languange to work with large climate datasets and observations.
