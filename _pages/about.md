Hi! My name is **Noribeth Mariscal**, and I am an atmospheric scientist specializing in **air pollution modeling**. I recently earned my PhD in Civil Engineering and Urban Sustainability at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, where I worked with Dr. Yaoxian Huang ([Huang Research Lab](https://www.huanglabwayne.com/)). My work focuses on the development and application of chemical transport models to understand air quality at exposure relevant scales. I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Environmental Modelling Group, working with Guy Brasseur, at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany.

## Research Expertise and Interests

My research focuses on:  
- **Global Chemistry-Climate Modeling at Exposure Relevant Scales**: Employ the regional refinement capabilities of CESM/MUSCIAv0 at resolutions of ~7 km or more. 
- **Tropospheric Ozone Chemistry**: Explore the impact of different emission scenarios on ozone production and loss processes in Southeast Michigan, US.
- **Field Campaigns**: Participation in the 2021 & 2022 Michigan-Ontario Ozone Source Experiment ([MOOSE](https://www-air.larc.nasa.gov/missions/moose/)) and the 2024 Utah Summer Ozone Study ([USOS](https://csl.noaa.gov/groups/csl7/measurements/2024usos/)).

I am particularly interested in projects that address **the impacts of tropospheric ozone atmospheric chemistry and its interaction with air pollution, human, and ecosystem health, using a high-resolution global modeling approach**.

## Skills

- **Earth System Modeling**: Extensive experience using the MUlti-Scale Infrastructure for Chemistry and Aerosols, Version 0 (MUSICAv0) and the Community Atmosphere Model with chemistry (CAM-chem) within the Community Earth System Model (CESM). 
- **Programming Languages**: Proficient in Python and bash. Familiarity with FORTRAN and NCL. 
- **Big Data Analysis**: Experience processing data from ground stations, aircraft data, mobile laboratory data, ground-based remote sensing.
- **Languages**: Native speaker of English and Spanish.
- **Communication**: Skilled at writing scientific publications and presenting at conferences.

## Key Achievements

- Collaborated on the **MOOSE** and **USOS** field campaigns, contributing to **the collection of stationary measurements and data processing of ozone and nitrogen oxides from Thermo Scientific analyzers and formaldehyde from the Picarro G2307**.
- Awarded the **National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Advanced Study Program Graduate Student Fellowship** and the **NCAR Atmospheric Chemistry Observations and Modeling (ACOM) Ralph Cicerone Fellowship**, which has allowed me to work with Dr. Louisa Emmons throughout my PhD.
- Selected as a participant for the **2024 ASP Colloquium on Integrating Atmospheric and Social Approaches to Improve Urban Air Quality**.
- Delivered presentations at the **American Geophysical Union Annual Meetings**, **the CESM Workshop**, and **the International Association for Great Lakes Research**.
